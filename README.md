- 👋 Hi, I’m @Lars818, a geotechnical engineer who is looking to transition into a data analyst role.
- 👀 I’m interested in working in a data driven role.  My current work as an engineer is fulfilling, but my role involves a significant amount of field work and overtime, so I am looking for a change.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning data analytics via the Google Data Analytics Certificate on Coursera.  I will continue my education with other bootcamp style learning programs, as well as self study.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that will help me learn SQL, R, and Python, as well as visualization programs such as Tableau and PowerBI.
- 📫 You can reach me via E-mail at lars.erickson@yahoo.com.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy traveling, hunting, fishing, and spending time with family.  I also play the occasional video game.
